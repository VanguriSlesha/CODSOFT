# Task 1: Rule-Based Chatbot ü§ñ

File name:codsoft1.py

This Python program is a simple **rule-based chatbot** that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules.  
It uses `if-elif-else` statements to understand the user's message and provide suitable responses.

 Features:
- Greets the user
- Replies about time, weather, and personal questions
- Ends the chat when the user types ‚Äúbye‚Äù or ‚Äúexit‚Äù

Concepts Used:
- Python string handling (`in`, `.lower()`)
- Conditional statements (`if-elif-else`)
- `datetime` module

 How to Run:
1. Download or clone this repository  
2. Run the chatbot:
   ```bash
   python codsoft1.py
